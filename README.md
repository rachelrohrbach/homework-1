## General info
This project is my personal web developer portfolio. It provides potential employers a showcase of my applications and skills. Witin the website you can learn some background about me and you will eventually be able to actually see examples of some of the projects that I have worked on. It also provides a contact form for interested parties to get in touch with me. The portfolio content is limited at this point as I have just begun learning to code, but it will grow and improve with time. 
	
## Technologies
This project is created with:
* HTML:5
* CSS

## Credits
I consulted W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) extensively in creating my project. Some other resources that I used include: *CSS-Tricks (#https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-backgroundTricks) and Stack Overflow (#https://stackoverflow.com/). I also used the GitLab repository for my course, specifically referencing in class activities.
